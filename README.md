# my-calc
I made this calculator , all on my own . the logic behind it's functionality is written by me without any help from outside sources . Yes I'm new to web development so I had to see the syntax of some functions from the web.

you can send your suggestions and edits to me on - ajay.kumar@talentelgia.in

enjoy :-)
